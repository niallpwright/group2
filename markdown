This analysis was designed to evaluate the hypothesis on how sports related stocks performed before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. 

**How did the sports related stocks perform during the pandemic?**
  we created a portfolio of 13 sport-related stocks and charted their prices through out the pandemic in a date range of 5-25-2019 through 5-26-2021, showing how and when they were affected.

**How long did it take for the sports-related stocks to recover?** 
we created a graph of the sports-realted stocks portfolio and zoomed into a 3 month window of March 2020 through June 2020 to show how and when they recovered from their initial dip in price caused by the pandemic worries.

**What is the prediction for post-pandemic?**
