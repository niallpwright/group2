## Playing The Game: How COVID affected sports-related stocks. 

This analysis was designed to evaluate the hypothesis on how sports-related stocks performed before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. 

**How did the sports-related stocks perform during the pandemic?**
  We created a portfolio of 13 sport-related stocks and charted their prices throughout the pandemic in a date range of 5-25-2019 through 5-26-2021, showing how and when they were affected.

**How long did it take for the sports-related stocks to recover?** 
We created a graph of the sports-related stocks portfolio and zoomed into a 3-month window of March 2020 through June 2020 to show how and when they recovered from their initial dip in price caused by the pandemic worries.

**What is the prediction for post-pandemic?**
There is a 95% chance that an initial investment of $1,000,000.00 in the portfoolio post- pandimic over the next 5 years will end within in the range of 994099.24 and 3310145.62

**From each of our chosen stocks(group members portfolios) which stock performed best?**
Nvidia shares have surged during the health crisis, making it the best performing stock in our group member's portfolios.

**How did our groups total portfolio compare to sp500 during pandemic?**

Our team portfolio performed well through the pandemic.  The entire market dropped in March 2020.
After the initial drop, a majority of stocks saw a full gap up recovery and are close to all-time highs halfway through 2021.
After analysis of 13 sports-related stocks, we had 11 stocks outperform the S&P 500.
FUBO, NKE, PENN, MGM, CHDN, EA, ATVI, TTWO, NVDA, BYD, BGFV.

**Outliers and interesting data**
 NVDA, PENN, WWE, are the outlier within the stocks we chose. Nvidia had record sales by strong demand for online gaming and remote computing services. Penn gaming had a strong performance due to states legalizing online gambling. WWE stock did not perform as well as the price was negative compared to the rest of the portfolio.

**Summary Conculusion**
Many industries suffered during 2020 and the economy took a step back during recovery. Our goal was to see how the sports industry fared during this time period by tracking the stock value of sports companies in different industries. The first step in our findings was to track portfolio performance prior to the US shutting down nationwide. After we accomplished that we used the data to run predictive simulations for the next 5 years. After we finalized our prediction we lined up our 13 stock portfolio against the S&P 500 (SPY) to get a good measure of total performance. In conclusion, we have found that sports-related stocks outperformed the market during the Covid-19 Pandemic. Throughout the total time period SPY registered a total growth of 47% - 11 out of our 13 stocks beat that target with several of our best picks posting over 100% gains.
